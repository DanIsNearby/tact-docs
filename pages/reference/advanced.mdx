Dangerous or unstable features meant to be used by advanced users only.

## readForwardFee
```
extends fun readForwardFee(self: Context): Int 
```
Read and computes forward fee from Context and return it as Int value in nanoToncoins.

## throw
```
fun throw(code: Int);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code`.

## nativeThrowWhen
```
fun nativeThrowWhen(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code` when `condition` equal True.

## nativeThrowUnless
```
fun nativeThrowUnless(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code` when `condition` equal False.

## getConfigParam
```
fun getConfigParam(id: Int): Cell?;
```
Loads network configuration parameter from the blockchain.

## nativeRandomize
```
fun nativeRandomize(x: Int);
```
Randomizes the random number generator with the specified seed.

## nativeRandomizeLt
```
fun nativeRandomizeLt();
```
Randomizes the random number generator with the current logical time.

## nativePrepareRandom
```
fun nativePrepareRandom();
```
This function prepares random number generator by calling `nativeRandomizeLt` once and called internally by `random` and `randomInt` functions.

## nativeRandom
```
fun nativeRandom(): Int;
```
You shouldn't use this function directly, use `random` and `randomInt` functions instead.
This function generates 256-bit random number just like `randomInt` function, but random generator is not initialized by `nativePrepareRandom` function.

## nativeRandomInterval
```
fun nativeRandomInterval(max: Int): Int;
```
You shouldn't use this function directly, use `random` and `randomInt` functions instead.
This function generates random number in the range from 0 to `max`. This call doesn't prepare initialization by `nativePrepareRandom` function.

## nativeReserve
```
fun nativeReserve(amount: Int, mode: Int);
```
Calls native `raw_reserve` function with specified amount and mode.
