# @stdlib/ownable

This library provides a contract traits for ownable contracts. This is most commonly used trait that is required by most other traits.

## Ownable
This trait declares an owner (non-editable) of a contract, provides a helper function `requireOwner()` that checks that a message was sent by an owner.

Ownable trait requires a field `owner: Address` to be declared and exposes get-method `owner` to read it from the contract.

### Usage

```
import "@stdlib/ownable";

contract ExampleContract with Ownable {
    
    owner: Address;
    
    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
    }
}
```

## OwnableTransferable

`OwnableTransferable` is an extension of an `Ownable` that allows to transfer ownership of a contract to another address. It provides a secure handle `ChangeOwner` that could be called by an owner to transfer ownership.

### Usage
```
import "@stdlib/ownable";

contract ExampleContract with OwnableTransferable {
    
    owner: Address;
    
    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
    }
}
```
