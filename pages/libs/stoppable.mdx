# @stdlib/stoppable

Traits that allows to stop contract. Useful for emergency or maintenance mode. Requires `Ownable` trait. This trait just manages a single flag `stopped` in the contract and handling stopped state have to be done in the contract itself.

## Stoppable

`Stoppable` trait implements receiver for message "Stop" that can be sent by owner, implements `stopped` get-methud that returns `true` if contract is stopped and provides private functions `requireNotStopped` and `requireStopped`.

### Usage

```
import "@stdlib/stoppable";

contract MyContract is Stoppable {
    
    owner: Address;
    stopped: Bool;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
        self.stopped = false;
    }
}
```

## Resumable

`Resumable` trait extends `Stoppable` and allows to resume contract execution.

### Usage

```
import "@stdlib/stoppable";

contract MyContract is Resumable {
    
    owner: Address;
    stopped: Bool;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
        self.stopped = false;
    }
}
```
