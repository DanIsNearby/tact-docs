# Common

List of a basic functions that are available in all smart contracts.

## context
```tact
fun context(): Context;
```
Return Struct `Context`, that consists of

| Field   | Type    | Description                                                                                                               |
|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bounced | Bool    | [Bounced](https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/addresses#bounceable-vs-non-bounceable-addresses) flag of incoming message |
| sender  | Address | Address of sender                                                                                                         |
| value   | Int     | Amount of nanoToncoins in message                                                                                         |
| raw     | Slice   | Slice reminder of message     

## require
```tact
fun require(condition: Bool, error: String);
```
Checks `condition` and throws an exception with `error` message if `condition` is false.

## now
```tact
fun now(): Int
```
Returns current unixtime

## myBalance
```tact
myBalance(): Int;
```
Returns the remaining balance of the smart contract as Int value in NanoToncoins, where NanoToncoin = Toncoin * 10^(âˆ’9). Note that `send` do not update this field.

## myAddress
```tact
myAddress(): Address;
```
Returns the internal address of the current smart contract as a Address.

## contractAddress
```tact
fun contractAddress(s: StateInit): Address;
```
Computes smart contract's Address in a workchain #0 based on its StateInit `s`, where `s` is a Struct consists of `code` and `data` Cells.

## contractAddressExt
```tact
fun contractAddressExt(chain: Int, code: Cell, data: Cell): Address;
```
Computes smart contract's Address based on its workchain id `chain`, `code`, `data`.

## dump
```tact
fun dump(arg: Any);
```

Prints argument to the contract debug console. `debug` feature has to be enabled in `tact.config.json`.
