# Masterchain

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Masterchain support must be enabled explicitly in project configuration. Without enabling it all masterchain addresses will be treated as invalid.
</Callout>

Most of the contract developers don't need a masterchain. Masterchain is needed only for participating in elections or storing libraries. If you don't need to participate in elections or store libraries, you don't need a masterchain.

## How contract is protected from masterchain

Most of the contracts written in `func` enforce all incoming addresses to be `basechain` one. This is done to prevent masterchain addresses from being used in the contract. Tact does this **by default**.

What prohibited to do without masterchain support enabled:
* Deploy contract to masterchain. `init` function would throw `Masterchain support is not enabled for this contract` error for every message.
* Receive messages from masterchain accounts.
* Receive structs that has masterchain addresses in it.
* Send messages to masterchain accounts.
* Use masterchain addresses in arguments of get methods.

## Enable masterchain support

To enable masterchain support, please enable it in the project configuration file:
```json
{
    "options": {
        "masterchain": true
    }
}
```
